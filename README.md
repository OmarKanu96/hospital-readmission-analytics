A data analysis project using excel to explore hospital readmission patterns, cost breakdowns, and risk indicators.
# Hospital Readmissions Analysis (Excel Project)

This project analyzes synthetic hospital data to identify patterns in readmissions, average cost per department, and patient risk groups using Excel.

## 📊 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- PivotTables & Charts
- Formulas (IF, COUNTIFS, AVERAGE, etc.)

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Summary
- Removed duplicate entries
- Created Length of Stay, Age Groups, and Total Cost per Patient
- Handled blanks in 'Readmitted?' column

## 💡 Key Insights
- Neurology had the highest readmission count and second-highest cost
- Cardiology had the lowest readmission volume but the highest cost per patient
- 70+ age group had the highest readmissions (~30%)
- Unexpectedly, non-readmitted patients had slightly higher average costs than those readmitted — suggesting further analysis needed
