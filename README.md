# hospital-readmission-analytics
A data analysis project using excel to explore hospital readmission patterns, cost breakdowns, and risk indicators.
# Hospital Readmissions Analysis (Excel Project)

This project analyzes synthetic hospital data to identify patterns in readmissions, average cost per department, and patient risk groups using Excel.

## 📊 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- PivotTables & Charts
- Formulas (IF, COUNTIFS, AVERAGE, etc.)

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Summary
- Removed duplicate entries
- Created Length of Stay, Age Groups, and Total Cost per Patient
- Handled blanks in 'Readmitted?' column

## 💡 Key Insights
- Neurology had the highest readmission count and second-highest cost
  - Suggests need for post-discharge follow-up.
- Cardiology had the lowest readmission volume but the highest cost per patient
  - Oppurtunity to manage high-cost acute cases.
- 70+ age group had the highest readmissions (~30%)
- Unexpectedly, non-readmitted patients had slightly higher average costs than those readmitted — suggesting further analysis needed

## 🚀 Next Steps / Recommendations

- Implement follow-up protocols in high-risk departments (e.g., Neurology) to reduce repeat visits.
- Conduct a total patient-level cost analysis to reveal hidden financial impact of repeat admissions.
- Explore predictive modeling opportunities using readmission and demographic data.
- Design age-specific interventions, especially for the 70+ group with the highest readmission rates.
- Build additional dashboards for department heads to monitor readmission KPIs in real time.
- Integrate EMR or insurance claim data for more advanced segmentation and forecasting.
